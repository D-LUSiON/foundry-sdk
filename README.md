# FoundrySdk

Foundry SDK is an Angular module that makes creation of software interfaces easier.

# WIP

This module is still in active development and I had no time to write a proper documentation. If you want to preview what's going on, clone the project:

``` git clone https://github.com/D-LUSiON/foundry-sdk.git ```

then open two terminal windows.

In the first window type:

``` ng build foundry-sdk --watch ```

and after build is finished and watching for changes in the second window type:

``` ng serve ```

then open a browser window with url *http://localhost:420*
